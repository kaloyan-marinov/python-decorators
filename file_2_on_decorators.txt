a decorator is just a function that:
    1. takes another function as an argument,
    2. "wraps the original function", which could mean:
        (a) "adds some kind of functionality"
        (b) "modifies behaviour"
        (c) "performs setup/teardown"
        (d) "minotors diagnostics (timing, etc)"
    3. and returns a newly-created function
(all of this without altering the source code of the original function that was taken as
an argument)
