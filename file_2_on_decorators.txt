a decorator is just a function that:
    1. takes another function as an argument,
    2. defines/creates an inner function that "wraps the original (input) function",
       which could mean that the inner function:
        (a) "adds some kind of functionality"
        (b) "modifies behavior"
        (c) "performs setup/teardown"
        (d) "minotors diagnostics (timing, etc)"
    3. and returns the newly-created inner function.
(all of this without altering the source code of the original function that was taken as
an argument)
